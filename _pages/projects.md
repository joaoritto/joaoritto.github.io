[<b>Doing Without Nominal Rigidities: Steering Employment and Inflation in a Monetary World</b>](/projects/1_project/)

<b>Abstract</b>: I develop an equilibrium monetary model based on search frictions tailored to the quantitative
study of the short-term effects of monetary policy. By decreasing the nominal interest
rate temporarily, a Central Bank induces an increase in the amount of liquidity in the economy
which results in persistent positive effects on output, employment and inflation. I estimate the
key monetary parameters to minimize the distance between the impulse response functions
to a monetary policy shock from the model and a vector autoregression. For variables like
output and employment, the model’s impulse response functions to the monetary shock are
comparable to the ones from a New Keynesian model of similar size. The response of firm
profits, labor productivity and the labor share are qualitatively in accordance with what is
found in vector autoregressions – something the New Keynesian model struggles to deliver.


[<b>Informality, Consumption and the Welfare Costs of Inflation</b>](/projects/2_project/)

<b>Abstract</b>: Developing economies have large informal sectors made up of small firms that avoid taxation
and rely predominantly on cash. The degree of formality of a household's consumption basket
varies widely across the income distribution. We develop a general equilibrium model with
a formality decision by firms and consumption bundle decision by households that jointly
rationalizes these facts and use it to evaluate the heterogeneous welfare costs of in
ation in economies with large informal sectors.

[<b>The neutrality of nominal rates: How long is the long run?</b>](/projects/3_project/)

<i>International Economic Review, November 2022, Volume 63, Issue 4, pages 1745-1777</i>

<b>Abstract</b>: We revisit the empirical relationship between policy interest rates and inflation aimed at understanding the reasons for persistently low inflation in Japan and the euro area and why monetary policy has been unable to raise it. We document the long-run positive relationship between nominal rates and inflation across countries and across time. We also find that a permanent rise in nominal rates leads to an increase in inflation, also in the short run. These findings suggest that the low inflation outcomes are a result of policy rates being kept too low for too long.

<b>Doing Without Nominal Rigidities: Real Effects of Monetary Policy in a Monetary World</b> (Job Market Paper) <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/0cvpq5gk28prjomjs8a9o/h?rlkey=piny2hux9dqomnrkya0ivdapm&dl=0">pdf</a>

<b>Abstract</b>: I develop a quantitative model of money as a medium of exchange, built on search frictions in the product and labor markets, which provides an alternative theory for the real effects of monetary policy. Due to matching uncertainty, firms operate below full capacity, and households carry money that ends up unused. A reduction in the nominal interest rate decreases the opportunity cost of holding money, pushing up householdsâ€™ money demand. The increased liquidity carried by households results in a decrease in money velocity but an increase in capacity utilization, as it becomes easier for firms to match households with money to purchase their goods. This delivers an increase in output and employment. I estimate the model to match the impulse response functions to a stimulative monetary policy shock in a vector autoregression and compare it to a model of nominal rigidities. The search-based model's response to the shock displays positive, persistent effects on consumption, investment, and employment. As in the data, the labor share is countercyclical, something the New Keynesian model is unable to deliver.

<b>The neutrality of nominal rates: How long is the long run?</b> (with Valle e Azevedo and Teles)

<i>International Economic Review, November 2022, Volume 63, Issue 4, pages 1745-1777</i>

<b>Abstract</b>: We revisit the empirical relationship between policy interest rates and inflation aimed at understanding the reasons for persistently low inflation in Japan and the euro area and why monetary policy has been unable to raise it. We document the long-run positive relationship between nominal rates and inflation across countries and across time. We also find that a permanent rise in nominal rates leads to an increase in inflation, also in the short run. These findings suggest that the low inflation outcomes are a result of policy rates being kept too low for too long.

<h3> Work in Progress </h3>

<b>Informality, Inflation, and Fiscal Progressivity in Developing Countries</b> (with Daniel Jaar)

<b>Abstract</b>: Developing economies have large informal sectors made up of small firms that avoid taxation
and rely predominantly on cash. In addition, poorer households purchase a larger proportion of their consumption bundle from informal firms. We develop a general equilibrium model with
a formality decision by firms and consumption bundle decision by households that jointly
rationalizes these facts and calibrate it to evaluate the implications of different revenue-equivalent choices of consumption taxes and inflation for aggregate output, the size of the informal sector, and fiscal progressivity.

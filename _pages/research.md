<b>Doing Without Nominal Rigidities: Real Effects of Monetary Policy in a Monetary World</b> (Job Market Paper)

<b>Abstract</b>: I develop a model of money as a medium of exchange based on search frictions tailored to
the quantitative study of the short-term effects of monetary policy. Following a decrease in
the nominal interest rate, money velocity decreases while firm capacity utilization increases,
resulting in positive effects on output and employment. I estimate the model to match the
impulse response functions of monetary policy shocks found in a vector autoregression and
compare it to a medium-scale New Keynesian model. Both models can deliver large and persistent real effects of monetary policy. Excluding inflation, the search-based model achieves a
better statistical fit, particularly because it can match the behavior of labor productivity, labor
share, and money velocity better than the New Keynesian model. However, it underperforms
for inflation. These findings suggest that liquidity-based effects of monetary policy constitute
a candidate solution to make the microeconomic evidence on price changes consistent with the
macroeconomic evidence on the real effects of monetary policy.

<b>The neutrality of nominal rates: How long is the long run?</b> (with Valle e Azevedo and Teles)

<i>International Economic Review, November 2022, Volume 63, Issue 4, pages 1745-1777</i>

<b>Abstract</b>: We revisit the empirical relationship between policy interest rates and inflation aimed at understanding the reasons for persistently low inflation in Japan and the euro area and why monetary policy has been unable to raise it. We document the long-run positive relationship between nominal rates and inflation across countries and across time. We also find that a permanent rise in nominal rates leads to an increase in inflation, also in the short run. These findings suggest that the low inflation outcomes are a result of policy rates being kept too low for too long.

<h3> Work in Progress </h3>

<b>Informality, Inflation, and Fiscal Progressivity in Developing Countries</b> (with Daniel Jaar)

<b>Abstract</b>: Developing economies have large informal sectors made up of small firms that avoid taxation
and rely predominantly on cash. The degree of formality of a household's consumption basket
varies widely across the income distribution. We develop a general equilibrium model with
a formality decision by firms and consumption bundle decision by households that jointly
rationalizes these facts and use it to evaluate the public finance decision of a Sovereign and its implications for fiscal progressivity.
